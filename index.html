	<h1>How this came to be</h1>
		<p>Chicago is a city that I have been calling home for almost 11 years now. I still remember seeing the famous skyline for the first time and feeling a mixture of awe 
		and disbelieve that this experience is real and not a part of some blockbuster movie I used to watch as a kid. I know this might sound dramatic and hard to understand. 
		But what can I say, I am a small town girl.</p>
		<p>What is more surprising that despite all of the wonder and glory of the initial encounter, I didn't fall in love with the city at the first sight. Chicago felt old and crammed. 
		Narrow oneways and dark alleys were in such stark contrast in my memory to the broad avenues of post-Soviet Minsk or cozy streets of Kiev, cities I used to call home.</p>
		<p>Slowly Chicago grew on me. I came to learn and appreaciate its stories and sectrets. So this website (a work in progress indeed) is a tribute to the stories the city has 
		to tell if you wish to listen. Some are marvelous and some are ominous. Bear with me and I will whisper secrets in your ear.</p>
